Project status overview
so it's good to see the visual representation of what's going on immediately the content highlights are giving me a good insight into kind of the the current status of what's what the work-in-progress looks like without me having to go into copious amounts of spreadsheets or other kind of collaboration tools to understand that so like that results over time I'm not sure what I'm not work clothes and now I'm looking at the at the axis there is well is that calendar weeks I'd assume calendar weeks and publish missed deadline what would I do with the missed missed deadline what would that lead me to do what would I take away from that bit is good to have a snapshot but I just need a little bit more guidance as to what I’d used that for. It’s nice to see if they're obviously the Green Bar which is the published is no it's good to see that there's some sort of increment there but I would challenge what the planned anything I just need a bit more clarity on on what are the key takeaways are that like what would my next steps be if they all of them were missed deadlines ok that would be quite scary looking bar for so that the axis went the other way and the plan to is planned and missed deadlines or that could look a bit more… I don’t know. I'm thinking Aloud and rambling a little bit. Probably need a little bit more guidance on that. Let's go to the bottom now working progress overview I mean it's nice to see where the bulk is it is good to see the where the bulk of the current work is so looking it that's that's quite nice and so I think the strongest part of this dashboard for me is definitely the top bit the content highlights and the bottom piece think that's they’re nice then I said just need a little bit more clarity on the middle one there.

So I wanna know straight away who is responsible for those who is the assignee of those content pieces and in order to kind of identify why the blockages have happened where the the biggest breakpoints are in those contents then I could try to eliminate those barriers and get them through. Definitely would be concerning to see all the missing due dates that would say to me why is there any due dates that's going to cause a bit of Chaos with getting content out so I probably want to investigate that part for sure and the undersigned that tells me that noone is going to be working on it potentially so I want to have a little look into why there's no they might just be newly created items and they're just it just someone is going through an assignment and confidence is what that means 

I'm definitely that would be a plus point I mean it doesn't is not a necessary step right now I guess because this is already a big improvement to go to this dashboard but I can imagine going through and clicking now just to get a quick overview what's delayed click View what's delayed click is on a side and then go through and be able to do some action points from those it would be nice to see a kind of the most recently published things in there so would need to.. You know someone sees a typo you know if i am an author of a magazine or managing that and it's all been published and someone sees a mistake or spelling error it’s easily you wann go to most recent and crack on and do a few tweaks there and it’s the way I see it

No that's nice to see that is just being filtered and can see that delayed on the left-hand side there I guess this is working is the current way that the content inventory works right so you'll be able to filter or organise based on usage is nice and then be able to say I see a lot of Martin Danko and pieces here be able to go through filter and tap into those so yeah think that's their already nice way to look it 

Not sure not sure I think because you've gone from 0 to effectively 100 already is quite nice to see it I'm not sure I've got an answer to say yeah definitely something key is key is missing from the content highlights might be nice to know the types of content I guess if it's going to go a stage further so you know we've got lot different content types and magazine publisher would have no longer and short form pieces of content they might have advertising space nursery might want to go ahead and have a look at what they paid publications are vs non paid so you could extend it further into the content highlights there and filter by that

Yeah I know I think it would be good if you've got the capability to kind of back at them seize that would be a nice way for us to go in and have a quick filter on those you know like I mentioned in Context most recently published articles if you go in and you'd be able to click on those and want to do some sort of quick tweek  between those add a link to a piece of content be able to go in and do it from there I know we can do that already from the content inventory is it just makes it that quicker bit quicker and easier and so therefore you are eliminating their kind of time to do in those tasks which is a big benefit I see from having these highlights

I am I would say so now like I like I mentioned a lot of content marketers even I do it now whereby I use different tools to manage content flow to answer this immediately would save me from from tapping into a spreadsheet or going into collaboration tools and project management elsewhere this could be a nice quick snapshot start of the day and then if I did want to take a deeper dive into the content or is a big master plan a campaign then I could go and check out the collaboration tools

I would prioritize which ones I cared about most obviously I would know what is currently in flight with bigger campaigns to smaller campaigns or you know bigger articles that are going to be published in the magazine and so I'd wanna check that the delayed or anything that's quite scary looking like the ones that ring alarm bells and be my first priority and is an impact in any of the upcoming content releases too drastically I mean most content marketers will building contingency so they might not see this is too scary but you still want to jump on it and make sure you can rectify it before it does have any big impact to your work in your overall deadlines so does that answer your question?

Looks like it's just an overview of counts of contents of total published their graphs hair look like it said can I make a burndown chart so looks like there's a concept of planning consent and then the concept that actually is being delivered I'm in a measure of that in which the message that makes sense

On the screen obviously the red underside of missing two dates are those things that are not been pushed forward for some reason and then these hair look like they're ones that have missed the deadline so they they were planned but they were messaging me it's two separate things may be delayed is is the same as that missing deadline green obviously is on track and see is being delayed the priority because they have a plan but they've been missed the target so I probably want to click on that immediately and see specifically what's delayed so I can understand why is this This what you were just describing we just have a beautiful just could do so so this was really probably noticed and why why we have this the Lace read it is a common theme is it is a single person who's been a bottleneck are we getting stuck on something if anything and yellow kind 
I think I mean we have the contributors but I would probably also want to make sure we have a clear owners not sure if that's a concept you have in the in the in the platform I mean when you have multiple contributors it's hard to understand you know who is responsible for the delay is who is really the person you need to talk to make sure it's getting pushed for itself to me having an owner or someone that I can look at to see if that's the good of the person I could talk to basically to find out what's going on I mean that we have different types of different workflow steps I think in and I'm trying to extrapolate this tutorial Projects so in a row project you know you might have in addition to the types and the current staff in the contributors you might have certain areas of the site of certain patents were you saying like looks like a product information is really getting delayed so I probably not be able to sort by type and see it for having consistent problem uncertainty hopeful not sure what else just just left hand 
How do you proceed next what are your next steps we have 26 content items till he gets it depends on the rate on the scenario with if this is a timeline driven organisation in these these constant items you know not getting published runtime is a major impact to business I probably react different than it was just the soft project I think there are generally depend…

… or depends on the urgency right so this is as a magazine I guess I assume that the magazine has really hurt deadlines so in that kind of case I think I would want to prioritise somehow so in or maybe the ideas of what's the content that's mission-critical vs ancillary content that be really helpful and based on that in a prioritised so if if we haven't we have a new issue of the magazine coming out on Tuesday for example we are what are the things that are holding that are completely ok I focus on those so again having an order and having may be some sort of impact the business or priority I think that would help too 
so the only thing as meeting the contributor and some fashion like the concept of being able to nudge and say like dude, get it done this is to get it that way beyond the concept of headless cms

Large icing is there any kind of messaging system in here to be able to in a ping them or send a message to change priority is there anything like that to alert the contributor that be really useful

This is basically had if we have some sort of process or flow this is basically the position of the how much content is in each step one thing I think that might be helpful at what two things really one would be no can you customise this to your particular needs in a different businesses have different needs you might not need all of these different steps you may need additional steps that can think but then I wonder if some sort of Visual like this is obviously a visual that maybe one that kind of shows the flow is it a linear flow is there are there like iterative Cycles that need to happen that kind of thing 

But like for me at any get every business is different so this is good because it just shows you know what percentage of content but it doesn't give you much information about how that impacts you rather than just a graph you know like are we are we getting bottlenecked is is that a problem
Two things come to mind so the first would beMaybe two things come to mind so the first would be an overall state like if you could somehow the fine if if you have more than 3 things now delayed the project is yellow and and then if you have more than 5 things too late it's red is it maybe just an overall state and I could be obviously you know any mail goes out if there is a change of state because of that but also think that in addition to some sort of overall state of red yellow green some some more advanced I mean in the future warning should be helpful so for example if it's Tuesday and you have 0 things that are red and Wednesday you have three things that are red and in on Thursday that five you are obviously burning in the wrong direction so we have this like this problematic velocity of a vicious and having having some sort of notification about that before they're actually added their delayed like it if they're about to be delayed because you're being held that then we'd have more time to react as opposed to email Mandy deadline day now when we do anything and I know that's not simple but it's just because I think if you're trying to control or manage our freely large flow content with the depicting getting ahead of the problems before they happen would be very high value
And I would say that one of the bigger potential abuse case is here is going to be that there's going to be like at See how that but plays or whatever that's going to have a global goal was like I need to publish 10 new blog posts in and having that kind of big picture of ok is this is my  I have to try to publish 10 of these and mods in my gonna hit that where am I and it's kind of coincides with stuff about this is that if I can get a sense for weird things
Obviously theres gonna be some big goals Is going to be like more engagement oriented goals that I would get from something like a google Analytics but frequently if you're like that director communications it's your your test with you have to publish 10 news articles a month in 5 weeks like that kind of there goes our communication so for them to be able to say ok so let's say you know that you have to publish this many moves in this Is any given time frame this is just gonna give you a status or are you going to warn you about your month is almost over and you've only done two out of 10
I like that idea because its gonna warn you I think it'd be pretty simple to have some some arrested for something against that so if it's the 15th of the month and even only 20% of your target then we have a yellow but it's not because you're late it's just because you're not on track for your goal and anything those cans of goals could be overall for the company but also individual goals because you may have been out and the concert and may have been out to bloggers need blogger has to do 10 a month and you know having them having their uncle said to add together 220 but individually they also have sort of saying Hey Girl behind I can see that been really high value you don't or something and then having a short Pier just to keep them on track especially if if you have a bigger team is going to be very difficult to track where everybody is and how productive they are against their goals in terms of output must you had some sort of target like that
